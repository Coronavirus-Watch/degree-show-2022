## Project Description

### The Problem

The School of Science and Engineering is currently using a paper-based approach to deal with incoming technical requests at the workshop, which causes many issues such as difficulty monitoring and organising paper files, lack of transparency and formality in the system as well as high paper usage.

### Project Aim

The aim of the project is to bring the current paper-based system up to date by developing a new accessible web-based technical request management system that could be used by three user types, namely client, supervisor and technical staff.

## Achievements

The web app is fully responsive, follows industry accessibility standards and its usability was positively evaluated by the technical staff and external users. The system imitates the request fulfilment lifecycle completely.

### Functionality

Main features of the system include:

- Creating a new request
- Tracking requests
- Approving pending requests
- Reviewing requests waiting in a queue
- Assigning requests
- Keeping record of materials used
- Leaving comments under request
- Viewing completed requests in archive
- Administrator rights

## Project Description
Typically, a person has 100 passwords, that they use and need to remember. As a result, many people experience password fatigue and adopt habits that reduce the security of their credentials. A reliable password manager can alleviate this, by requiring a user to remember only one password. This project developed a password manager, which operates and store credentials locally, without the need for internet connectivity and provides increased security, when compared to existing systems.


## Project Findings
The developed system successfully stored credentials in a secure database file. Additionally, it narrows the exposure window of unencrypted credentials in memory.

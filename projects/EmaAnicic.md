## Project Description
The purpose of this Honours Project is to create a tool that will allow for end-user creation of smartphone-based text adventure games. The focus is on end-user development and making the tool easy to use for both the game creators and game players. The goal is to allow users to create and play text games without having any previous programming knowledge and without having to go through hours of tutorials.

- Smartphone-based (for Android users)
- User and touchscreen-friendly interface
- Users can create and play text-based games without any prior programming knowledge
- Users can share their created text-based games with other users on the application

## Project Findings
There are surprisingly few text-based game creation tools that are smartphone-friendly, which is a unique quality of this project. The application was be developed in Java in Android Studio with Firebase integration for the realtime database and user authentication tools.

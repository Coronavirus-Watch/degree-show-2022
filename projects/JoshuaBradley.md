## Project Description
With roughly 15% of the world’s population living with some form of disability, understanding and empathy have become vitally important.

The ‘Accessibility Through Empathy Simulation Application’ (ATHESA) is a web app with a single purpose – to increase understanding and empathy towards people that have disabilities. The application was made using Angular and hosted on Firebase. 

## Project Findings
After various questionnaires and interviews, I carried out a thematic analysis. From this I observed 3 major findings:

 - A person with a disability can experiences a variety of situations due to their disability 

 - There can be variation and lack of understanding about disabilities 

 - People can benefit from experiencing 'virtual' disabilities 

I also gathered quantitative data from interview participants which suggested that ATHESA was an effective tool:

 - The average understanding of disabilities by participants before using the application was 6.7/10 and this increased to an average of 9/10 once they had used the application. 
 
 - There was a similar rise in the participants’ empathy too, with a self-assessed empathy average of 6/10 before using the application and an increase to 8.3/10 after they used the application.

## Project Demo
Below is a quick video explaining the project and a demonstration of it in use.

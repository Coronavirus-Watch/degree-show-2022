## Project Description
The aim of this project is to create a text to speech system modelled from work in the 1980s. It uses linguistic rules and a set of processes to break down text into samples of sound. This set of processes is as follows

1. Format the text correctly, this includes breaking numbers (9) into text (nine)
1. Break the text down into it's component sounds (hello -> h/eh/l/ow)
1. Turn these sounds into parameters for a speech synthesiser using a set of rules
1. Use these parameters along with a synthesiser to make samples

The project was based on the MITalk system from Cambridge university, with many other influencing projects.
## Project Findings
The project was successful at creating vocalisations of some common words, achieving good intelligibility scores with users. It also offers an easy to use front end for users to interact with the system.

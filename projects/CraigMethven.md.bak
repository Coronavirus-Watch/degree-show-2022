## Project Description
Marking students code can be a time intensive process with some syntactical problems never being brought to light due to the time it would take to comment on each occurrence of the issue.

Written in Java, this program allows users to see errors within Java, C, C++ and C# code.
This program aims to decreases the time it takes for lecturers and students to evaluate code in order for feedback to be received swiftly and to a higher standard.

## Product Description
An error report containing all of the errors found within the code is displayed and can be downloaded in order to be shared with students. 

Checks include:
- Checking that methods and classes have a comment above them
- Checking that recursive functions take in at least one parameter
- Checking that variable, method and class names match naming convensions
- Checking that methods are not too large
- Checking that strings are compared correctly

Additional functionality is also present with the ability to search for terms and compare against other code.

These error reports can also be displayed beside the code in order for the marker to see the error in context quickly.

## Project Description
The Arturius Odyssey is a first person shooter set within a fully simulated small scale planetary system, where the largest planet has a radius of only 105m. It was heavily inspired by the video games Outer Wilds (Mobius Digital, 2019) and Doom (id Software, 2016), which influenced the space gameplay and the combat gameplay respectively.

## Game Premise
You play as a maintenance robot aboard the Arturius, a colony ship that has just arrived within an unexplored planetary system. Unfortunately the Arturius is attacked by a hostile alien species, creating a large hole in the hull. You, as well as nine cryogenic pods, are sucked out into open space. Your objectives are to find and recover the cryo pods, and to help repair the Arturius.

Throughout the game the player is provided with opportunities to sacrifice parts of their own robotics. Some examples would be; they can reduce their maximum health by 30% which will help to repair the hole in the ship, or they can lose the ability to double jump which will help the Arturius to steer out of the way of explosive mines.

Depending upon the number of sacrifices and upgrades that the player makes, they will receive one of seven possible endings. All of the endings also vary slightly depending upon which specific sacrifices and upgrades were made.

## Features of Interest
1. Planets and other physics objects that behave according to the law of gravitation
2. An atmosphere shader that is somewhat based on reality
3. A volumetric cloud shader that is somewhat based on reality
4. Enemy AI that utilises the state design pattern and the A* pathfinding algorithm
5. First person shooting
6. Snow deformation

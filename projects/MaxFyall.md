## Project Description
The aim of this project was to create a prototype plotting program using OpenGL and C++. Experimenting with the capabilities of OpenGL (C++) to create a program that can plot in 2-D and 3-D space in a variety of different ways e.g. Scatter plot, Line graph, bar chart.

## Project Findings
The libraries and functions of OpenGL (C++) have the ability to create a basic plotting program. With the correct application of code, data can be processed and sent to the screen in a variety of ways. It is due to this possibility that opens up a plethora of OpenGL features that could be used to extend the program further and beyond with additional development.

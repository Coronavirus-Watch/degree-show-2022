## Project Introduction
The Fractal Dimension (FD) is known to a morphological parameter of the retinal vasculature commonly used as a biomarker.

## Project Description
The main objective that was focused in this project was that I had to estimate quantitatively the variation of Fractal Diminsion (FD) values that were etimated by the VAMPIRE (Vessel Assessment and Measurement Platform of the Retina). VAMPIRE is a research project that are driven by University of Dundee and Edinburgh. VAMPIRE's main mission is to provide effective image and data analysis tools in the research analysis community. 

## Project Findings
The main findings and results in the project were as the Fractal Dimension (FD) values are decreased in values when the Gaussian noise as been increased.

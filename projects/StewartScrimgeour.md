## Project Description
Accessibility needs will always be present no matter if a person is born with it or they develop it. However not everyone is aware of this fact or account for the fact. It was identified that there is a lack of awareness for accessibility in the modern day.

The aim of this project was to spread awareness of accessibility through the use of serious video games as an educational tool. This was inspired by the video game “Dumb Ways to Die” which helped to spread awareness about railways safety and showed a real decrease in accidents and deaths on railways.

## Project Findings
The testing showed that everyone who played it thought about accessibility and at least gained a little understanding towards the topics presented in the games. Additionally, when asked, the testers had said they would not have been thinking about accessibility at all that day if not for the game. The student considers this a small success already as the whole point of the solution was to spread awareness and get people thinking about accessibility.

One tester had commented that they had enjoyed the light-hearted presentation of a serious topic. This was a surprising but welcome comment as this is another reason as to why serious games should be considered in educational purposes. This is because what would normally be a heavier topic that people might not want to acknowledge has become a light-hearted game that the user would seek out to have fun.

The student found that video games can be an effective way to spread awareness and to aid in education. The student’s own model was implemented with 2 phases of user testing, the feedback of which showed that video games are effective in making a user think more about everyday accessibility concerns and effectively spreading awareness. This is conclusive with the research which shows that video games can be used as an effective way to spread awareness and aid in learning.

The aim of this project is to develop an online learning and collaboration platform for the company PBSuk. PBSuk specialise in helping people with complex needs and one of the things they do is provide a series of training programmes for Positive Behavioural Support (PBS) practitioners. The problem they are currently facing is that they have no easy or accessible way in which to share additional resources and videos with practitioners, or a way for practitioners to communicate and interact with each other. The aim of this project is to provide them with a solution to this problem.

Throughout this project, Adam has be engaged with the client to undergo a full Agile Software Development Cycle in order to gather requirements, design, develop and test a website that will be launched to provide a platform for PBS practitioners to access supporting material, additional training videos and a forum where they can communicate with other practitioners. The platform will consist of two main areas:

- **Resource Hub** - This will be a collection of additional resources to support the already existing training courses that PBSuk provides. Here, practitioners will find additional training videos, supplementary documents and any other useful resources to aid their learning.
- **Forum** - This will provide a space where practitioners can interact with each other, ask for advice and share any help or experience they may have.

## Project Description
The first page a practitioner is faced with is the login page. From the login page, practitioners can access the password reset system or log in to the main site. Once a practitioner is logged in, they are presented with the landing page which acts as the main hub of the platform. Here they will see a list of announcements submitted by administrators, updating them on any news or new information that may be important to them. From the landing page, practitioners can navigate to the rest of the site. They can access the resource bank, which provides them with all the additional materials and videos to aid their learning and development. These materials are split into courses so that the practitioners can easily find what information they are looking for relevant to the course(s) they are participating in. Practitioners can also access the forum where they can communicate with other practitioners and share resources and information with each other in a private, secure and confidential environment.

Administrators have additional features above a standard practitioner which allows them to create and manage practitioner accounts, edit their details and assign them new courses as they enrol in them. They also have the ability to upload and manage materials in the resource bank and assign these materials to their relevant course. It will be an administrator's responsibility to review new forum posts before they are made public so they can be fact checked and proofread for accuracy. If a post needs to be amended, they can send some feedback to the original author who can login and change the post accordingly, and once they are happy that the post is appropriate, it can be approved and made public for practitioners to view and interact with.

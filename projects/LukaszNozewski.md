## Project Description
The purpose of this project was to create an analytical tool that would aid anyone who writes code. Primarily targeting people who do code reviews. Whether it be in a professional setting such as a supervisor doing code reviews or a teacher checking over a student’s submitted work. The program would tokenize the submitted source code and segment the user-specified “Qualities”. These qualities include Comments, Variables, and Functions. Under each quality is a sub-quality that is checked for, these include Naming Convention, Word Likeness, and Average Word Likeness. All this data is then compiled into final statistics which show the overall real-world usage as well as comment frequency and therefore, provide an insight into the overall quality of the code.

## Project Findings
<b>Basic parsing of code</b><br>
Before starting this project the concept of parsing was very foreign to me. It was something I used through compilers however never fully understood. The nature of this project required me to understand the process of parsing and recreate the first couple of steps. This was something that took a lot of reading to understand, and is by far the thing that I am the most proud of.

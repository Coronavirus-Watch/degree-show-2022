## Project
Emojis are small pictograms, smileys, or logos embedded into text. For users that use screen readers, an emoji is identified and read aloud by its 'descriptor'. Such as, 'Face with tears of joy'.

There are currently 39 million blind people on Earth, meaning that if they were to navigate online a screen reader would be one of the few ways to do so.

It is proven that the visual depiction of emoji provides a gigantic number of social cues, benefits, and generally 'richer' communication for users. However, due to emojis being replaced by simple narration, blind users miss out on all the aforementioned benefits.

Therefore the idea for this look at an under explored way to convey emoji emotional playfulness: sound effects

## Steps
The aim of the project was to end up with an add-on for the screen-reader 'NVDA', this add on would attach to the screen reader and work to swap out the emoji alternative text narration with the custom tones. To do this:

- First the emojis were selected, this was based on the top 100 most popular emojis of 2021. The top 20 were selected and an additional 12 to cover more bases were also selected.
- Once emojis were selected, two sets of sounds were created by one voice actress sourced from reddit and the other a friend of mine. Having two versions was important as the creation of the sounds was largely up to interpretation.
- A survey was the developed to analyse the effectiveness of the sounds, comparing them to the emoji visual depictions as well as the text descriptors. This survey was also used to find which sound was preferred for each emoji.
- The plugin was developed, swapping out the default emoji text for the created, preferred sound effect.

## Project Findings
The emoji, sound, and alternative text were scored by participants on 3 scales. These scales were based on the circumplex of emotion - pleasance and activation. A highly pleasant and highly activated emoji may be something like excitement or ecstasy. The third scale was added by me for interest, how sarcastic the user thought the media was.

 There were 26 sound emojis. 15 times, the sound scored a more similar result than the text compared to the emoji visual. The text was closer 8 times,  and the remaining 3 emoji did not collect enough data to compare. These findings suggest that sounds have the potential to elicit a better emotional response than plain alternative text, which is exciting considering there is a lot of room to improve the curation process of the sounds. 


## Project Media
Below are three examples of the curated sounds and their associated emoji default narration.

## Project Description

The aim of this project was to design and develop a website for the VAMPIRE Research Group. The website was developed using multiple technologies such as ReactJS and NodeJS and is completely powered by Google's Firebase services.

## Project Findings

My main objective throughout the project was to work on the backend system of the website. This involved the creation of a CMS that can be logged into on the website by an authenticated user as well as a thorough integration with Google Firebase Cloud Firestore.

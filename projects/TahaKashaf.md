## Project Description
My project is a Machine-Learning powered Sentiment-Analysis model aimed at classifying vaccine sentiment on a State-To-State basis in the USA. Using this data, and other metrics (Political leaning, education rates, mandate policies, etc.) I'm attempting to paint a picture to explain *why* specific States have specific sentiments towards Vaccination (primarily, the Covid-19 Vaccinations)

## Project Findings
The Project Finding can be found *soon* on my very own website, made to present the results I have found.

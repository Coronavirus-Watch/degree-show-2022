## Project Description
The School of Science & Engineering (SSEN) has a workshop and several other machine shops that can be used to create, repair and maintain equipment, apparatus, and other items by full-time technicians.
The workshop staff currently operate a paper-based request system which requires those wishing to submit a request to complete a form with contact details, the nature of the request, and even enquire about the use of specific materials.


## Project Findings
The aim of the Honours project was to create a software application to replace the current paper based system.  The web solution, developed using PHP, provides many features which will help workshop technicians better manage requests and aid efficient utilisation of resources.
Some noteworthy features of an online request include: adding an item of material or equipment; automated e-mail receipt; status tracking from request review through to job completion.

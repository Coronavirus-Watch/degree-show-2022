## Introduction
VAMPIRE (Vascular Assessment and Measurement Platform for Images of the REtina) is an international collaborative project of several image processing groups. They developed a software application for efficient, semi-automatic quantification of retinal vessel properties with large collections of fundus camera images. However, the research groups website design has not changed since it was initially created, which is why it had a very outdated appearance. The old website did not present VAMPIRE as a professional and modern research group due to its old design.

For reasons mentioned beforehand, the goal of this project was to create a new and a more modern looking VAMPIRE research website, while also improving my own understanding of React and modern development principles. My focus during this project was working on the websites front-end, however it still required me to develop some backend functionality.

## Description
The project was made using a waterfall model it consisted of different planning stages:
- Requirements gathering
- Design
- Implementation 
- Testing
Each stage was completed before the next stage began. As mentioned, most of the project focused on the front-end experience of the website. This was developed using one of JavaScriptâ€™s libraries React. A framework Material UI was also used to allow easier development and a more consistent design. 

I worked together with another CS4 student. However, I was focused on the front-end development while my colleague developed the backend. 

## Conclusion
Overall, the project was successful and a website with a modern design produced. However, there are a lot of improvements that can still be made since not all requirements could be implemented due to time constraints as well as some pages like the Home page could be optimized to load at a faster rate.

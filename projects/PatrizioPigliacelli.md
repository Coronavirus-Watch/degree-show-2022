## Project Description
The project is an Action-RPG 3D game made for everyone who loves this genre. When a player starts, the program can navigate through two menus, one to choose a language, and the other he can select one of the various options. Such options are to start a new game, load a previously saved game or read the stories of the island or the hero. He can also open the credit screen, quit the game or open the setting menu to change the keys to use while playing the game and regulate volumes or shadows strength. 
When the player starts a new game, he begins in one of the three island cities where the game takes place.
Speaking to villagers, the player can learn what to do and where he has to go to proceed with the story. While he travels to his final destination, the player can fight different enemies to gain experience and gold. With the obtained experience, the player can level up, increasing his stats and learning new magical spells. With gold, he can increase the strength of his weapon and shield, buy items or rest at the inn to recover. There are also chests hidden around the world containing gold or potions.
A demon treats the island, and it is the player's duty, since it is all his fault, to save it by defeating the boss. It is the player's fault because... Well, if you want to know more, play the game.

## Project Findings
The main finding was that coding in 3D is much different and more challenging than expected. But it was also funnier and more satisfying achieving this challenge.
This game has various features with the most useful in the setting menu. Those are the volumes and shadows strength regulation and the ability to change the key so that the player can play using any key he prefers.
The best aspects while playing the game are Trents and new spells obtained while levelling up. Trents are monsters that look like trees, and the player has no clue which tree is a monster and which is normal, which gives the element of surprise.

## Project Media
If you are really keen you can also create a video to demonstrate your project and embed this in the page. An example of a youTube video being embedded is below. You will want to change the width of this to be 100% and put the height as something around 500.

## Project Description
Getting a proficient first aider to the scene of an incident as quickly as possible can be the difference between life and death. Currently Dundee University lacks a modern system to get an adequate responder there before an ambulance or further assistance comes. This project aims to propose and demonstrate a new system that could function on top of the existing, improving upon immediate response time. This system, crucially consisting of a mobile application, could use information from the device to make much more informed alerts.

The system proposed could utilise locational information gathered from nearby Wi-Fi access points and GPS, aiming to guide first-aiders to the scenes of incidents without confusion.

## Project Findings
The proposed system combines a React-Native mobile app, a React web app and Firebase services to notify and direct the most relevant first-aider to where they need to be.

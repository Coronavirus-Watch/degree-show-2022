## Project Description
The software I have developed allows a user to build and visualise their own Spacecraft using either preloaded parts like solar panels, chassis etc or also by importing their own parts. They are also able to alter their material properties like how reflective each part is and their dimensions. After the model has been created, the user is able to export it in a standart format such as .obj

## Project Description
Fake news, its growing propagation, and the effects this has on our society is a growing topic of discussion both in literature and the media. This application aims at providing journalists and everyday online media consumers with a toolset to help identify fake news articles and statements. Utilising multiple different datasets with a selection of different conventional machine learning models users are provided with a range of fake news classifiers. By giving users this range of training datasets and classifier types they are able to pick a combination of these that fits their needs best.

## Project Findings
Utilising support vector machine, multinomial na√Øve bayes and random forest classifiers accuracies exceeding 93% were achieved in the identification of fake news articles. Providing users with the option to choose which dataset their models were trained on offered them both binary and multiclassification prediction outputs, a range of model metrics to choose from and an overall ability to pick which dataset suited their needs best.

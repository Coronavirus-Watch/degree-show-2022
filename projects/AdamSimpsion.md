## Project Description
The main aim and goal of this project is to investigate the reconstruction and generation of skin lesion images using an unsupervised variational autoencoder in order to learn a representation of these lesions.

A variational autoencoder (VAE) is a type of neural network consisting of an encoder to encode an image down to a latent representation, and a decoder to decode that representation back to an image. This project aims to investigate and analyse how changes within this VAE affect the reconstruction and generation of skin lesions in order to learn an accurate representation of them.

These representations have the potential to then be used for a multitude of purposes like assisting with diagnoses, prognosis or even treatment of skin lesions.

In order to produce and learn an accurate representation of skin lesions, this project will analyse how factors like latent space dimensionality and data augmentation affect the accuracy of the generation and reconstruction of lesions.

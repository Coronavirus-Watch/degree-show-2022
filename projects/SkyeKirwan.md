## Project Description

This project aims to enable the monitoring of microaggressions in a workplace. 

### Problem
Microaggressions are subtle but pervasive acts of discrimination that negatively affect individuals or groups based on their identity. These inequalities are hard to measure as they are often made unintentionally. Although a singluar incident is small they are pervasive and over time can cause serious harm. Through education and awareness microaggressions can be reduced to create a more inclusive culture. 

### Solution
The implemented solution is specific to the University of Dundee but may be altered to suit any workplace. 
The system is in two parts:  

- A simple and friendly web-app for people who have experienced or witnessed a microaggression to anonymously report the incident within their institution. 
- A dashboard to monitor the reports submitted. This gives alerts, shows trends and highlights visually where there are high volumes of incidents happening.

### Technology Used 
Both the web-app reporting tool and monitoring dashboard were built using React, Material UI, Node.js Express, MySQL and various libraries. 

## Outcomes
Institutions can use the knowledge from this tool to effectively address microaggressions and improve the equality of their workplace through targeted campaigns/ trainings that raise awareness, educate and reduce bias. 

This project was shortlisted for the Association for Black and Minority Ethnic Engineers (AFBE-UK) 'Next Big Idea' pitch in the Equality and Diversity category. Skye presented at the 2022 AFBELive Conference and was awarded a Runner Up prize. More information:

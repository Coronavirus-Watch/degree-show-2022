## Project Description
“PANGU v5 is a powerful toolset for modelling, and generating high resolution images of, surfaces of planetary bodies such as Mars, the Moon, Mercury and asteroids.” The PANGU software has been developed to model planetary bodies which can then be used to generate a range of simulated data. Currently the models generated by PANGU can be further enhanced by users of the software however the process of doing this is removed and requires the user to have prior experience with PANGU. The goal of this project was to create an accessible solution to this, allowing users to enhance their models with a more conventional too integrated with the existing PANGU program. Over the course of this project, a Web bases solution has been developed allowing users to enhance three-dimensional asteroid models by adding surface details such as rocks and craters.


## Project Findings
The Editor allows users to upload their asteroid models in a .glTF format, these models can then be enhanced by adding boulders and craters to the surface. These changes are then save to a ‘Boulder List’ can ‘Crater List’. These Lists are then passed to PANGU which can then use the User created lists in the model creation process, generating the specified surface details. The Generated models can then be exported in a number of formats or used further in PANGU simulations

## Project Description
Many people suffer from anxiety and stress everyday. While there is no one cure that will work for everyone, research has shown that working towards and setting goals can be an effective method to alleviate symptoms.

The aim of this project is to develop a pilot system that is intended to help users to manage their feelings of anxiety and stress, while staying within SSE Ethics constraints.

The system that was developed aims to help users by guiding them through a four step goal setting process.

## Project Findings
The project was a success and a robust web application was created. Users were consulted in the design phase to ensure the system would be strcutured appropriatley. The goal setting process was refined multiple times due to the extensive background research that was carried out. The system is realiable, responsive, and secure. Overall this project was a success and was completed to a good standard.

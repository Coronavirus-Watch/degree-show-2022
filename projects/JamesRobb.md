## Project Description
Unidirectional social media platforms such as Twitter can often act as breeding grounds for the creation of echo chambers online. This project contributes a framework that allows users to be able to critically view and analyse their Twitter social network. By building on previous work from political sentiment analysis, data visualisation, and network analysis a python framework for collecting a userâ€™s Twitter network to determine the interests, communities, and political biases of all users within the network was developed.
Using the output from this framework, the D3 JavaScript library was used to create two interactive visualisations. These visualisations allowed users to apply filters to the network data in order for users to interact with and view their social network in a way that allows them to gain a deeper understanding of the bias behind the accounts that they interact with online.
